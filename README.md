# SmartGym

A webapp that tracks your sport exercises and provides analytics and a leaderboard. At the moment only pushups are supported.

I made this side-project to practise deploying a server-side ML app to edge devices.

Used model: [MoveNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/pose-detection/src/movenet)

Used stack: TensorFlow.js, Node.js, Parcel.js

Credits to the [TensorFlow.js examples repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/webcam-transfer-learning) for providing a starting point for this project (but I had to re-code almost everything).

## Try this app live at <https://smartgym.hamdi.cc>!

Note: This app is still in active development, this is a preview.
